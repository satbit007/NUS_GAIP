Project Report: Multi-label Classification of Chest X-Rays
1. Introduction
The aim of this project is to address the need for an accurate and timely interpretation of chest X-ray images to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating various lung diseases effectively. A chest X-ray is a common and cost-effective medical imaging test, but clinical chest X-ray diagnosis can be challenging. This project employs advanced multi-label classification techniques based on deep and machine learning to accurately classify and anticipate lung ailments from chest X-ray images.

2. Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to improve chest X-ray diagnosis by utilizing artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms. Clinical chest X-ray diagnosis can be difficult and sometimes more challenging than chest CT imaging diagnosis. By developing a robust AI-based chest X-ray prediction system, we aim to provide an economical and accurate solution for chest X-ray disease detection, allowing patients to identify lung diseases and take necessary precautions. Additionally, this project aims to extend its services to businesses and research sectors to aid in the development of next-generation radiology tools.

3. Problem Statement
